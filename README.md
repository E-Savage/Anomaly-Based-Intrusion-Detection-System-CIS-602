# Anomaly-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System-CIS-602
Develop an anomaly-based network intrusion detection tool that operates in real time. Create a program that continuously collects network activity from their own system. Benign data will be used to train an anomaly detection algorithm. After a data collection period, the tool must demonstrate its ability to detect abnormal network activities.
